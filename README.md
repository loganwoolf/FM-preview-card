## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

Was interesting trying different filters on the greyscale image to get the color filter just right.

```css
		.grid-container>img {
			border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;
			max-height: 99%;
			filter: sepia(0.08) hue-rotate(232deg) saturate(40) 
                    brightness(0.65);
		}
```

### Continued development

I intend to focus on improving my CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox skills. I feel like I may have some unnecessary lines trying to get the two squares to line up properly.
